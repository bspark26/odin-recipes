        I make these crepes <strong>ALL</strong> the time for my kids and nephews. They are always a favorite!

        This is a very basic recipe. Only requires a few basic ingredients that most people should have on hand.
    </p>
    <br>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 cup all purpose flour</li>
        <li>2 eggs</li>
        <li>1/2 cup milk</li>
        <li>1/2 cup water</li>
        <li>1/4 tsp salt</li>
        <li>2 tbsp butter, melted</li>
    </ul>
    <ol>
        <li>In a large mixing bowl, whisk together the flour and the eggs. Gradually add in the milk and water, stirring to combine. Add the salt and butter; beat until smooth.
        </li>
        <li>Heat a lightly oiled griddle or frying pan over medium high heat. Pour or scoop the batter onto the griddle, using approximately 1/4 cup for each crepe. Tilt the pan with a circular motion so that the batter coats the surface evenly.
        </li>
        <li>Cook the crepe for about 2 minutes, until the bottom is light brown. Loosen with a spatula, turn and cook the other side. Serve hot.
        </li>
    </ol>
